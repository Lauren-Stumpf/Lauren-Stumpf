### BSc Dissertation/Project:
* Deep Ensembled Truncated Quantile Critic with Recurrent Networks (DETRN+) - [R2D4-RL](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/dissertation): 84, 11th in year. [Tensorflow]

    > I supplement the sparse task reward with a dense task-independent intrinsic reward. I then research and combine the most appropriate recent state of the art namely ensemble learning, hindsight experience replay, D2RL, R2D2 with some novel practices and architecture such as a new data augmentation scheme and dropout layers. I produce a Deep Ensembled Truncated Quantile Critic with Recurrent Networks (defined in this paper). The final agent is extremely competent and surpasses the performance of all surveyed approaches. It is able to complete the three manipulation tasks inspite of the sparse and uninformative task reward. It is also able to generalise across environments. We also demonstrate some of the best practices to exploit a predominately intrinsic reward signal.
  
* Deep Learning - [StyleGAN2-ADA](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Deep-Learning-Coursework): 100/100, 1st in year. [PyTorch]
    > ![Gifdemo245](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Deep-Learning-Coursework/blob/main/images/complete_1.png)
    > 
    >  The task was to generate realisitic and diverse images (using the FFHQ dataset) given severe hardware constraints and then to interpolate smoothly between these images. To do this, this paper proposes using a StyleGAN2 architecture in combination with an adaptive discriminator augmentation (ADA) mechanism trained on the FFHQ dataset. This mechanism passes the images shown to the discriminator through an augmentation pipeline and dynamically adjusts the strength of augmentation.

* Reinforcement Learning - [TQC+D2RL](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Reinforcement_Learning_Coursework): 100, 1st in year. [PyTorch]
    >![Gifdemo2](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Reinforcement_Learning_Coursework/blob/main/bipedal_walker_score%3D330.gif)
    >
    > We were tasked with creating a Reinforcement Learning agent to complete the Bipedal Walker gym environment. To do this, this paper surveyed and evaluated four different approaches (Twin Deep Deterministic Policy, Soft Actor Critic, Augmented Random Search and Truncated Quantile Critic) for the Bipedal Walker environment and distinguished Truncated Quantile Critic as the most advantageous. It focuses on performing a robust and comprehensive hyperparameter sweep (as initial trials indicated that all agents were very sensitive to hyperparameter choices) to find the hyperparameters most suitable for the Bipedal Walker environment. It then augmented the neural architecture by incorporating findings from D2RL. The resultant agent is able to solve both the BipedalWalker and BipedalWalkerHardcore environments.


* Recommender Systems - [NeuMF+RRN-Recommender-System](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Recommender_Systems_Coursework): 89, 4th in year.
    > ![Gifdemo](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Recommender_Systems_Coursework/blob/main/recommender_system.gif)
    > 
    > I implemented two state-of-the-art deep model-based recommender systems (RS), a novel content-collaborative hybrid RS and a solely collaborative RS. These RSs foster user satisfaction in different ways; the first by capturing the complex user-item interaction structures and the second that exploits temporal data. To compliment these RSs I created a fully-fledged UI where user can log in, register, submit new reviews and retrieve personalized movie recommendations using our two recommender systems. Due to being highly optimized, the recommender can retrain itself almost instantly when a user submits a new review or on alteration to a prediction which allows the user to interact with the recommender and see the recommendations change in real-time.

* Independent Reasearch Project - [advancing-SOTA-supermarios](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Independent_Project): 90, 1st in year. [Pytorch]
    > ![Gifdemo1](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Independent_Project/blob/main/mario_video.gif)
    > 
    > During my Independent Project, I surveyed the field of Reinforcement Learning and spent my project investigating how best to combine many recent advances from Reinforcement Learning. In doing so, I created an AI agent capable of teaching itself to play the game Super Mario Bros. to superhuman level, achieving new state-of-the-art performance within the field. This demo shows the agent playing Worlds 5 and 7.

* Bioinformatics - [bio](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Bioinformatics_Coursework): 100, 1st in year. 
    > ![Gifdemo1](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Bioinformatics_Coursework/blob/main/log_likelihood.png)
    > 
    > Coursework implementing the Baum-Welch algorithm, discussion of implementation choices (normalising alpha and beta values, working in log space, parallelization etc.), verification of correctness, in addition to answers to problem sheets on different techniques for amalgamating rooted phylogenetic trees.
   
* Computational Modelling in the Humanities and Social Sciences - [mp_geography](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Computational_Modelling_in_the_Humanities_and_Social_Sciences): 79, 19th in year. 
    > ![Gifdemo1](https://github.com/Lauren-Stumpf/Computational_Modelling_in_the_Humanities_and_Social_Sciences/blob/main/MFA_graph.png)
    > 
    > This report causally models the geographical distribution of MP’s place of birth, at a regional and historical county level, temporally from the first Parliament to present day. This analysis facilitates an evaluation of how geographically representative the MPs elected over time have been and highlights areas that are underrepresented or overrepresented.

Fair representation, as asserted by Philips [3], is achieved by there existing a loose correspondence between the experiences of those in government and their electorate [4]. This analysis provides an important dimension in answering how well the UK government has achieved fair representation. It finds specific relevance in understanding whether the historic regional funding bias [5] can be attributed to the geographic representativeness of MPs.
